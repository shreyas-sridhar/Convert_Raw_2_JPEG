For production, use a WSGI server like **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** with a reverse proxy (e.g., **Nginx**):

1. **Install Gunicorn**:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. **Run Gunicorn**:
   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
   ```

3. **Set Up Nginx**:
   - Configure Nginx to reverse-proxy requests to Gunicorn.
   - Ensure proper permissions for `uploads/` and `outputs/` directories.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

- **File Size Limit**:
  The maximum file upload size is set to 50MB by default. To modify, update:
  ```python
  app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = <size_in_bytes>
  ```

- **Supported Formats**:
  Modify or expand the supported RAW formats in the `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` set.

- **Timeout**:
  For large files, increase the timeout duration in the `process_images()` function.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Large Files Not Uploading**:
  Ensure the file size is within the configured limit.
  
- **File Permission Errors**:
  Verify that the `uploads/` and `outputs/` directories have proper read/write permissions.

- **Conversion Fails**:
  Confirm that `rawpy` and `imageio` are properly installed and can handle the file format.
